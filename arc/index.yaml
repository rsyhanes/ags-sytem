  # ---------- ID & path conventions ----------
  conventions:
    # Specs
    spec:
      id_pattern: "<context>.<feature>.v<version>"
      example_ids:
        - "todo.mvp.v1"
        - "users.register-user.v1"
      path_template: "./specs/{spec_id}.spec.yaml"

    # Contracts
    contract:
      http_openapi:
        id_pattern: "<context>.openapi.v<version>"
        base_dir: "./contracts/openapi"
        example:
          id: "users.openapi.v1"
          path: "./contracts/openapi/users.v1.yaml"
      messaging_asyncapi:
        id_pattern: "<context>.events.v<version>"
        base_dir: "./contracts/asyncapi"
        example:
          id: "todo.events.v1"
          path: "./contracts/asyncapi/todo-events.v1.yaml"
      schema_json:
        base_dir: "./contracts/schemas"
        note: "Used for driven ports (e.g., EmailSenderPort, RepoPort)."

    # Rule packs
    rules:
      packs_dir: "./rules/packs"
      examples:
        - "domain.purity.yaml"
        - "ports.contracts.yaml"
        - "adapters.conformance.yaml"
        - "web-api.yaml"
        - "messaging.yaml"

    # Code layout for bounded contexts / services (Ports & Adapters Lite)
    layout:
      pattern: "src/BoundedContexts/<context>.<layer>"
      layers:
        Domain: "Pure domain model and invariants."
        Application: "Use-cases/application services; orchestrates domain; depends on domain."
        Infrastrure: "Implementations of ports: HTTP, DB, messaging, etc."
      examples:
        - "src/BoundedContexts/OrderProcessing/AGS.WindowsAndDoors.OrderProcessing.Domain"
        - "src/BoundedContexts/OrderProcessing/AGS.WindowsAndDoors.OrderProcessing.Application"
        - "src/BoundedContexts/OrderProcessing/AGS.WindowsAndDoors.OrderProcessing.Infrastructure"

  # ---------- How agents should operate ----------
  agent_flow:
    - "1) Read './arc/index.yaml' (this file) to understand layout and conventions."
    - "2) Read './arc/agent-guidelines.md' for implementation and folder rules."
    - "3) Load the target spec from './arc/specs'. Specs are the source of intent."
    - "4) From the spec, resolve referenced rule packs in './arc/rules' by ID."
    - "5) From the spec, resolve referenced contracts in './arc/contracts' (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schemas)."
    - "6) Plan changes that:"
    - "   - respect the Ports & Adapters layout,"
    - "   - keep domain free of framework/infra,"
    - "   - keep adapters conforming to contracts."
    - "7) Implement only files/paths that align with the declared layout and spec."
    - "8) Generate or update tests that map 1:1 to scenarios defined in the spec."
    - "9) Do not introduce new top-level directories or patterns without updating './arc/index.yaml' and './arc/agent-guidelines.md'."

  # ---------- Source of truth priorities ----------
  precedence:
    - "Specs (*.spec.yaml) define feature intent, scope, and scenarios."
    - "Contracts (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schemas) define I/O truth and port shapes."
    - "Rules & packs define reusable constraints; specs reference them by ID."
    - "Tests & evals prove conformance to specs, contracts, and rules."
    - "Views (4+1) and diagrams are documentation only; they must not contradict specs/contracts."
    - "Ontology is a navigational/analysis layer built from the above, not a separate truth."

  rules_of_engagement_for_agents:
    - "Always start from this index and the referenced spec; do not guess structure."
    - "Honor the Ports & Adapters layout when adding or modifying code."
    - "Do not duplicate rule definitions; use rule pack IDs from './arc/rules'."
    - "If a new rule is identified and does not exist, ask before creating it."
    - "If a spec and a view disagree, follow the spec and contracts but propose the view update."
    - "If a required path or ID is missing, propose a minimal, consistent addition under this structure."
