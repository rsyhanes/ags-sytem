Provide a Light 4+1 Architecture View (No Extra Content, Just Links & Diagrams)

Goal: Give humans one map, without new truths and maintain architecture docs that don’t go stale as fast.

Do (once it feels useful):
Create /arc/views:

logical.md: diagram + links to contracts/specs.

development.md: folder layout + “we use ports/adapters”.

process.md: picture of how calls or messages flow.

physical.md: “we deploy on Azure”.

scenarios.md: link to specs & tests.

Rules:

These files never own the truth.

They just point to specs, contracts, rules, tests.
